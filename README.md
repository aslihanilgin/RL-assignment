# RL-assignment

Packages used while development:

| Library     | Version   |
|-------------|-----------|
| numpy       | 1.23.5    |
| matplotlib  | 3.7.1     |

There is no need to set a seed value within numpy as this has been done within the files _assignment.py/Assignment.ipynb, generate game.py, and Chess env.py._

There are two possible ways to run the code:

**Using Jupyter Notebook**
Run each cell within Assignment.ipynb. Choose one of the deep learning algorithms to run and skip the other one.
**Running assignment.py**
This is a Python file that consists of cells that you can run within VSCode. Alternatively, you can run the code as normal as follows: 

`python assignment.py`

Make sure you comment out one of the deep learning algorithms before running the program.
